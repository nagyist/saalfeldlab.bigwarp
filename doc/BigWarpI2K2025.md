# Manual image registration with BigWarp

[Halfway to I2K 2025](https://www.i2kconference.org/workshops)
Nov 18, 2025


> BigWarp is an intuitive tool for non-linear manual image registration that can scale to terabyte-sized image data. In this
> workshop, participants will learn to perform image registration with BigWarp, apply transformations to large images, import and
> export transformations to and from other tools, and fine-tune the results of automatic registration algorithms. BigWarp makes
> heavy use of the N5-API to store and load large image and transformation data and meta-data using the current NGFF formats HDF5,
> Zarr, and N5. In addition to basic usage, the concepts, tips, and best practices discussed will extend to other registration
> tools and help users achieve practical success for realistic and challenging data. Users will also get an introduction into an
> excellent use case for OME-NGFF.
